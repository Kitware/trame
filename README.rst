3D Visualization
-----------------------------------------------------------

With best-in-class VTK and ParaView platforms at its core, **trame** provides complete control of 3D visualizations and data movements.
Developers benefit from a write-once environment while **trame** simply exposes both local and remote rendering through a single method.

Rich Features
-----------------------------------------------------------

**trame** leverages existing libraries and tools such as Vuetify, Altair, Vega, deck.gl, VTK, ParaView, and more, to create vivid content for visual analytics applications.

Problem Focused
-----------------------------------------------------------

By relying simply on Python, **trame** focuses on one's data and associated analysis and visualizations while hiding the complications of web app development.

Desktop to cloud
-----------------------------------------------------------

The resulting **trame** applications can act as local desktop applications or remote cloud applications both accessed through a browser.


Installing
-----------------------------------------------------------

trame can be installed with `pip <https://pypi.org/project/trame/>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install --upgrade trame

Usage
-----------------------------------------------------------

The `Trame Tutorial <https://kitware.github.io/trame/docs/tutorial.html>`_ is the place to go to learn how to use the library and start building your own application.

Optional dependencies
-----------------------------------------------------------

When installing trame using pip (`pip install trame`) you will get the core infrastructure for any trame application to work but more advanced usage may require additional dependencies.
The list below captures what may need to add depending on your usage:

* **pywebview**  : Needed for desktop usage (--app)
* **jupyterlab** : Needed to run inside jupyter-lab
* **notebook**   : Needed to run inside jupyter-notebook
* **requests**   : Needed when using remote assets such as GDrive files


Environments variables
-----------------------------------------------------------

* **TRAME_LOG_NETWORK**     : Path to log file for capturing network exchange. (default: None)
* **TRAME_WS_MAX_MSG_SIZE** : Maximum size in bytes of any ws message. (default: 10MB)
* **TRAME_WS_HEART_BEAT**   : Time in second before assuming the server is non-responsive. (default: 30s)


Life cycle callbacks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Life cycle events are directly managed on the application controller
and are prefixed with `on_*`.

* **on_server_ready**     : All protocols initialized and available for client to connect
* **on_client_connected** : Connection established to server
* **on_client_exited**    : Linked to browser "beforeunload" event
* **on_server_exited**    : Trame is exiting its event loop

* **on_server_reload**    : If callback registered it is used for reloading server side modules


Reserved state entries
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The shared state allow us to synchronize the server with the client.
Rather than creating another mechanism to handle similar needs throughout
the application we purposely reuse that state internally. To prevent any conflict with any user we are prefixing our internal
variable with `trame__*`. In general those state values should not be use
or changed by the user except for the one listed below:

Read/Write:
  - **trame__favicon**: Update it to replace the displayed favicon in your
    browser. The content needs to be an image encoded url.
  - **trame__title**: Update it to replace your page title
    (tab name / window name).

Read-only:
  - **trame__busy**: Provide information if we have pending requests waiting
    for the server to respond.
  - **tts**: Template Time Stamp to regenerate sub elements when a template
    gets updated. Usually used as `:key="tts"` to force some component
    rebuild.
