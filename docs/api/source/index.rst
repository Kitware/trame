Welcome to Trame's documentation!
=================================

.. note::

   Trame supports desktop, client/server, cloud and Jupyter as execution environment.
   But we also provide a refined API to make it more robust and future proof.
   Trame allow integration of vue2/3 components into its Web applications
   while also streamlining community contribution for new widgets.
