# Introductory course

For those who wish to know more about the internals of trame, this developers
course consists of a two-hour training video, as well as associated course
slides, exercises, and a compact reference document.  This course was
originally presented to a group of Kitware developers, and is now available
to anyone who wishes to fully leverage trame’s powerful capabilities.

The course describes trame’s architecture; guidance on how to set up a Python
virtual environment for trame; various ways to work with internal state,
event, ui, and widgets; approaches to working with VTK.js, VTK, and ParaView
including VTK’s data processing pipelines along with client-side and
server-side rendering; interfaces to the Python and Jupyter ecosystems; and
ways to deploy trame as a desktop application or in the cloud.
