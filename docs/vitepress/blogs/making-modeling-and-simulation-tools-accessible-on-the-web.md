In today’s fast-paced digital landscape, making advanced modeling and simulation tools available on the web is essential for teams that need to collaborate and scale their workflows. But how can you effectively transition these tools to a browser-based environment while ensuring smooth performance and user-friendly interfaces?

In this free webinar, our experts provide a comprehensive guide on how open source software solutions can help you create and deploy web-based modeling and simulation applications. Whether you’re looking to set up a web user interface, integrate 3D rendering for pre- and post-processing, or enhance analysis with plotting tools, this webinar covers everything you need to know.

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Web-Based User Interfaces:** Learn which tools can help you build intuitive, interactive interfaces for your simulation workflows.
* **3D Rendering:** Explore the best open source software for providing real-time, high-performance 3D rendering, including VTK, vtk.js, and ParaView.
* **Data Analysis and Visualization:** Discover how to integrate plotting tools and generate reports directly in the browser.
* **End-to-End Workflows:** Find out how platforms like trame can simplify and accelerate the development of your web applications, allowing you to handle everything from data input to simulation and result visualization.
