Are you looking to develop visualization applications with cutting-edge medical imaging technology?

Kitware can help you realize your product. We have an extensive track record of developing medical visualization applications and scientific software development platforms using web technologies ([VTK-js](https://kitware.github.io/vtk-js/docs/), [Trame](https://kitware.github.io/trame/), [VolView](https://volview.kitware.com/), [Glance](https://kitware.github.io/glance/index.html), [ITK-Jupyter-widgets](https://itkwidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [ITK-wasm](https://wasm.itk.org/en/latest/)) as well as native desktop toolkits ([VTK](http://vtk.org), [ITK](https://itk.org/), [3D Slicer](https://www.slicer.org/), [Paraview](http://paraview.org) and their customizations).

VTK and VTK-js include best-in-class 3D medical visualization techniques such as customizable cinematic volume rendering, enhanced lighting, and transfer function editing, demonstrated through our implementation in VolView and 3D-Slicer that can further enhance the user experience and workflow in radiological and diagnostic applications. Our platforms can leverage modern immersive technologies such as OpenVR, OpenXR, and WebXR to create [virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR)](https://www.kitware.com/vtk-js-transforms-web-based-visualization-with-immersive-virtual-and-augmented-reality/) interfaces. Some latest examples include deployment on light-field displays such as the [Looking Glass](https://www.kitware.com/lookingglassvtkmodule-v1-0/) using VolView and head-mounted displays (HMDs) using 3D Slicer.

We support a broad range of technologies such as application development in C++, Python, C#, and Javascript and user interface development in Qt, WPF, React, and Vue. Additionally, [*trame*](https://www.kitware.com/trame-revolutionizing-visual-analytics-with-python/) is our Python-based integration framework that enables non-web developers to create powerful, complex client-server web applications supporting large-scale data processing and visualization. Whether you want to deploy platform-agnostic web apps or develop highly efficient and responsive desktop applications that can be deployed on clinical workstations, we can support you in leveraging our versatile open-source platforms to achieve your product. We can work with you in many different ways, whether it is rapid development of usable/viable prototypes, improving usability, optimizing performance and troubleshooting latency issues, or providing training and support for leveraging and making the most out of our various high-quality open source platforms.

As you explore options for your visualization product development strategy, consider how collaborating with Kitware can provide a unique advantage to help you bring your innovative technology to market. We will be demonstrating these and other technologies at the [RSNA conference](https://www.kitware.com/rsna-annual-meeting-2023/). If you are attending RSNA, please stop by our booth #4367 for an in-person discussion or [request a meeting](https://www.kitware.com/contact/project/) with our technical experts for a virtual consultation.
