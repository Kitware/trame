# Applications

Trame has been used to build more than a dozen of applications in the last year or so within Kitware.
Many of those of applications have been developed for our customers in a closed source fashion.
Unfortunately we can only showcase trame via our OpenSource applications and examples.

For example the application below was develop through a partnership with [M-Star](https://mstarcfd.com/) and allow to run CFD simulation and look at the results live thanks to their extremenly fast solver. ArrowFlow allow CFD engineers to create simulation templates and easily expose them to their engineers through a bounded set of parameters.
