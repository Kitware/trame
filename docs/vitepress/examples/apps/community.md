## [SpinView](https://mxjk851.github.io/SpinView/)

SpinView is a general interactive visual analysis tool developed for multiscale computational magnetism that allow users with interdisciplinary backgrounds to simplified their own workflow, speeds up analysis of complex datasets and trajectories, and enables new types of analysis.

The key features are:

- User friendly: Enjoy the combination of Command-line-interface, WebUI and DesktopUI
- Post-processing: Denoising, Clip, Rescaling, try the visual exploration and data mining with SpinView!
- Feature-rich 3D visualization: Visualize your simulation result with glyphs, e.g., sphere, cone, arrow, plane, box, and any 3D models generated by yourself. Overlap everything including reconstructed mesh and isosurface.
- Extendable: Currently support .out (UppASD), Non-binary .ovf (Mumax3, OOMMF, Spirit), and .data (Vampire) output files and can easily extend to other magnetic simulation code.
- Shareable: Take snapshoot, rendering a trajectory video, make a portable interactive HTML file with only one click!
- Community support: Open-source (GPL V3) and free to use, based on Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Trame, and Pyvista.
