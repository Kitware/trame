# HPC

High Performance Computing is a world on its own where every center may have its own set of rules. So due to the specificities it might be worth [reaching out to a specialist at Kitware](https://www.kitware.com/contact/) to discuss what options might be available for your environment.

## Open OnDemand

For more general purpose system, we've created a simple template for [Open OnDemand](https://osc.github.io/ood-documentation/latest/index.html#) that is available [here](https://github.com/Kitware/trame-ondemand-bc-cone) for reference.

## Analytics Gateway

[InfiniteTactics](https://infinitetactics.com/) has created a bridge for trame applications to be easily integrated into their [Analytics Gateway](https://analyticsgateway.com/www/index.php/analytics-gateway/) solution. The Analytics Gateway is a portal that allows for easily running software/plugins on desired nodes types (depending on needs) with persistent data.  

## Need some help, missing information?
