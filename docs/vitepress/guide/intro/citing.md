# Citing Trame

While you can use the [repository DOI](https://zenodo.org/records/14991811), we now have a paper that would be more appropriate to cite.

Here is the Bibtex definition that you could use.

```bibtex
@article{Trame,
    author = {Jourdain, S. and O'Leary, P. and Schroeder, W.},
    title = {Trame: Platform Ubiquitous, Scalable Integration Framework for Visual Analytics},
    journal = {IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications},
    month = {March},
    year = {2025},
    doi = {10.1109/MCG.2025.3540264},
}
