## Setup the VTK environment

***trame*** requires Python 3.6+ but since ParaView 5.11 is bundling Python 3.9 we will use Python 3.9 in this tutorial.

```bash
python3.9 -m venv .venv
source ./.venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install trame                   # Install trame core
pip install trame-vuetify trame-vtk # Install widgets that we'll be using
pip install "vtk"
```

**Notes**:
 - `venv` was added in Python 3.3.
 - On a Mac with ARM architecture, VTK is only available with Python 3.9.

## Running the application

```bash
python ./00_setup/app.py --port 1234
```

Your browser should open to `http://localhost:1234/`

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="../images/tutorial-hello-trame.jpg" alt="Hello trame" style="width: 75%; height: 75%"></p>

**Notes**:
 - The default port is 8080, but since this is very common we will use 1234 for our Tutorial.
 - If you are running this on a remote machine, you may have to set the host to 0.0.0.0 to allow any external connection. (`python ./app.py --port 1234 --host 0.0.0.0`)

## Annotation of Hello ***trame*** Application

We start by importing the basic building blocks for our client-server application.

```python
from trame.app import get_server
from trame.ui.vuetify import SinglePageLayout
```

from ***trame***'s `app`, we import the factory function for retrieving a server instance on which we will bind our UI and business logic. We also import a skeleton for a single page client application that relies on vuetify (our main widget library) from `trame.ui.vuetify`.

Next, we define the graphical user interface (GUI) by passing the server to which it should be bound. Then with that layout we update the toolbar's title to read `"Hello trame"`.

```python
server = get_server()

with SinglePageLayout(server) as layout:
    layout.title.set_text("Hello trame")
```

Finally, we start the Web server using:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    server.start()
```

`start` can take an optional argument of a *port* number. However, this can be set with command-line arguments (`--port 1234`).

**Running the Application**

```bash
$ python ./00_setup/app.py --port 1234

 App running at:
 - Local:   http://localhost:1234/
 - Network: http://192.168.1.34:1234/

Note that for multi-users you need to use and configure a launcher.
And to prevent your browser from opening, add '--server' to your command line.
```

Your browser should open automatically to `http://localhost:1234/`.
