# Tutorial

We walk you through the basics of ***trame***, creating a simple but full-featured VTK example application.

It is easiest to work through the tutorial from within the ***trame-tutorial*** repository. The tutorial is organized into the following ordered sections:

1. [Download](./download)
2. [Setup](./setup)
3. [VTK](./vtk)
4. [Layouts](./layouts)
5. [HTML](./html)
6. [Application](./application)
7. [ParaView](./paraview)

For trame v1 we made a [video on __Web Visualization__](https://vimeo.com/651667960) recorded during  SuperComputing conference in 2021. The first 45 minutes go over the various technologies and solutions while the rest focus on trame v1 and its associated tutorial.

The tutorial is now updated using trame v2 which differs slightly from the syntax presented during that video.
