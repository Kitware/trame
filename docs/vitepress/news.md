Wow, I'm so impressed by #trame's impact.

We are at 30K downloads a month... If you are enjoying it, don't forget to add a star.

I always love seeing how **trame** gets used in the wild. This led me to add a community page to showcase your application.

So far, we have **SpinView**, a general interactive visual analysis tool developed for multiscale computational magnetism, which Qichen Xu developed at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden.

Kitware is delighted to announce that a trame tutorial will be given during the Siggraph Web3d conference in October of this year in San Sebastian, Spain.

We will present all our solutions for web scientific visualization and give a full hands-on tutorial about trame, i.e. how to bring your scientific data visualization onto the web, all through Python (no Javascript).

More about the Web3D conference that will happen in October 9-11 2023. (https://web3d.siggraph.org/)

While documentation is an ongoing process. I'm excited of the new trame website which includes a lot of examples and references to get started with trame.
