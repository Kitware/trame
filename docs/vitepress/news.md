__Top Python Frontend Libraries for Data Science__ - HiRETOP

In the ever-evolving world of data science and machine learning, Python remains a dominant language, thanks in large part to its vast ecosystem of libraries. Among these, frontend libraries have become essential for professionals looking to translate complex data into accessible and interactive web applications. Here's an insightful exploration of the top Python frontend libraries, each offering unique capabilities to enhance your data science projects.

__Trame: Interactive and Visual Richness__

Trame is another notable mention for data scientists and engineers looking to build interactive web applications with rich visualizations, including 3D models and sophisticated simulations. Leveraging libraries like VTK and ParaView, Trame excels in scientific and engineering applications. Its approach to creating reactive, stateful applications is promising, although the relatively new framework means a smaller community and potential growing pains as it continues to develop.

__The Best Python Frontend Libraries For Data Science__ - Alessandro Fiori

Developing web and desktop applications requires knowledge of several programming languages. Defining user interfaces is a fundamental aspect of providing a good user experience (UX) and viewing information in an effective and appealing manner. For those involved in analysing data or collecting it, however, this aspect is critical. In fact, many developers specialise in one language and are reluctant to expand their knowledge to other languages or tasks that are not their core business. For this reason, in this article we present five libraries in python that can facilitate and speed up the development of user interfaces.

__Webifying UncertainSCI Using Trame__ - Jess Tate

Web deployment of research tools has become increasingly important as the commercially available computing platforms become more diverse. However, the web deployment of Python packages and applications, especially with a GUI, has traditionally required significant training in javascript or a similar web language. Trame is a Python JavaScript integration framework that simplifies the GUI development and web deployment for Python apps. We used trame to deploy UncertainSCI, our Python package for uncertainty quantification (UQ), on web browser and cloud services.

UncertainSCI non-invasively computes forward model uncertainty propagated from input variability. It uses weighted approximate Fekete points (WAFP) to parsimoniously sample input parameter space, and polynomial chaos emulators (PCE) to accurately estimate model variation of complex computer simulations. UncertainSCI has been developed for use in 3D bioelectric field simulation to work with 3D biophysical models, balancing accurate multivariate analysis with computation cost.

The process of deploying UncertainSCI on the web was greatly facilitated by trame. Because trame interfaces with JavaScript packages such as vue.js, and vtk.js, we were able to implement a tailored interactive web-based GUI with Python code. Building and running a web app has been made simple through trame’s docker support, making deploying on webservice providers like AWS steamlined for low traffic use cases.

In this presentation, we will describe UncertainSCI, how we used trame to build web apps and web services, and how users can use UncertainSCI to perform UQ on their modeling pipelines.

**Interactive Web-based 3D Visualization of large scientific datasets using Azure Batch**

![Microsoft Azure](/assets/logos/azure.svg)

Scientific computing has long relied on high-performance computing (HPC) systems to accelerate scientific discovery. What constitutes an HPC system has continued to evolve. Access to computing keeps getting democratized and HPC is no longer limited to multi-billion dollar government laboratories and industries who can afford the infrastructure. Anyone with access to the Internet can now easily leverage the ubiquitous cloud for their computing task du jour! Azure natively supports HPC by providing hardware suitable for high performance computing needs together with software infrastructure to make it easy to harness these resources. In this post, we focus on one such Azure infrastructure component, Azure Batch, and see how it can be used to support a common use-case: data browser with interactive 3D visualization support.
