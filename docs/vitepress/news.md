Trame: Frontend With Vue.js, but in Python

You may have heard about Vue.js — a javascript library for quick one-page websites and UIs, a performant library with easy development. But what you may not have heard of is Trame — a library for Vue.js, but in Python!

This is what happens when you let an engineer play for the first time with **VTK** and **trame**.

Wow, I'm so impressed by #trame's impact.

We are at 30K downloads a month... If you are enjoying it, don't forget to add a star.

I always love seeing how **trame** gets used in the wild. This led me to add a community page to showcase your application.

So far, we have **SpinView**, a general interactive visual analysis tool developed for multiscale computational magnetism, which Qichen Xu developed at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden.

Kitware is delighted to announce that a trame tutorial will be given during the Siggraph Web3d conference in October of this year in San Sebastian, Spain.

We will present all our solutions for web scientific visualization and give a full hands-on tutorial about trame, i.e. how to bring your scientific data visualization onto the web, all through Python (no Javascript).

More about the Web3D conference that will happen in October 9-11 2023. (https://web3d.siggraph.org/)

While documentation is an ongoing process. I'm excited of the new trame website which includes a lot of examples and references to get started with trame.

**Interactive Web-based 3D Visualization of large scientific datasets using Azure Batch**

Scientific computing has long relied on high-performance computing (HPC) systems to accelerate scientific discovery. What constitutes an HPC system has continued to evolve. Access to computing keeps getting democratized and HPC is no longer limited to multi-billion dollar government laboratories and industries who can afford the infrastructure. Anyone with access to the Internet can now easily leverage the ubiquitous cloud for their computing task du jour! Azure natively supports HPC by providing hardware suitable for high performance computing needs together with software infrastructure to make it easy to harness these resources. In this post, we focus on one such Azure infrastructure component, Azure Batch, and see how it can be used to support a common use-case: data browser with interactive 3D visualization support.
